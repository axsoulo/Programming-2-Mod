This project is a mod for Balatro, hit indie success. It works by using the Steammodded API, abbrieviated as SMODS. I create several objects using classes defined by the API to make additional Jokers, Vouchers, Decks, Editions, and Seals. 

I attempted to get a varied amount of functions here, and I tried to make each object do something unique so that I could explore what the API had to offer. This was also coded in lua and this is the first time I've touched the language so there was some challenge there.
